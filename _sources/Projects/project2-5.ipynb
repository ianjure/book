    "This week marks a significant consolidation phase in the EQODEC project, where the previously developed components in data preparation, model architecture, carbon-aware loss design, and early evaluation methods were unified into a complete, reproducible, and research-grade experimental framework. Building on the structured dataset workflows from Weeks 1–3 and the early training and EES development from Week 4, the focus this week was to fully operationalize the robust evaluation pipeline and establish a stable methodology for comparing EQODEC against the baseline model under carbon-aware objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent with the pivot introduced in Week 4, the project now exclusively uses the Vimeo-90K dataset for both training and benchmarking, replacing earlier plans involving the UVG high-resolution dataset due to its high computational costs and carbon overhead. This decision not only simplified the pipeline but also strengthened alignment with EQODEC’s sustainability-driven objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Finalization of the End-to-End EQODEC Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "This week completed the transition from a prototype pipeline into a full experimental system capable of performing multi-run, multi-metric evaluation. The entire architecture including the ConvGRU-based autoencoder, quantization module, reconstruction engine, and carbon proxy was rewritten into a unified file to eliminate fragmentation, ensure reproducibility, and simplify debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A fully modular **CarbonModule**, responsible for carbon proxy computation and CodeCarbon instrumentation.\n",
    "* A cleanly separated **Recon+BPP loss** versus **carbon-aware loss**, preserving experimental flexibility as emphasized in Week 3’s architectural refinements.\n",
    "* A more stable **encoder–temporal–decoder pipeline**, replacing the earlier ConvLSTM with a lighter ConvGRU to reduce training cost and improve inference speed, consistent with the environmental motivation outlined in Week 1’s background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these improvements formed the final version of the EQODEC model used for all replicates this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Full Implementation of the Robust Multi-Run Evaluation Engine**\n",
    "\n",
    "A major milestone was the successful construction of a fully automated robustness evaluation framework capable of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Running **N = 5 independent training replicates** for both baseline and EQODEC models, as established in Week 4’s initial multi-run setup.\n",
    "* Saving the **best-performing model per replicate** based on validation loss.\n",
    "* Performing **per-epoch EES computation**, allowing temporal analysis of sustainability effects throughout training.\n",
    "* Aggregating metrics across replicates and exporting structured JSON and CSV summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final robustness engine computes mean, standard deviation, and per-run variance for key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Energy Efficiency Score (EES)**\n",
    "* **PSNR on the test set**\n",
    "* **Model overhead time**\n",
    "* **Compressed output size**\n",
    "* **Model-attributed kgCO₂ overhead**\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework is now the analytical backbone for determining whether carbon-aware optimization improves real-world efficiency without sacrificing visual fidelity, as required by the Week 1 project objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Refinement of the EES (Energy Efficiency Score) Evaluation Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "This week significantly improved the EES system introduced in Week 3 and Week 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Enhancements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* FFmpeg-based compression is now **streamed via rawvideo pipes**, improving stability compared to earlier iterations.\n",
    "* The model and baseline are encoded using distinct CRF settings, enabling meaningful GB-savings measurement.\n",
    "* CodeCarbon is integrated at the entire evaluation-run level, attributing carbon cost proportionally to inference and encoding overhead.\n",
    "* All temporary videos are automatically cleaned to minimize disk usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting EES formulation provides a practical estimate of:\n",
    "\n",
    "**GB of storage saved per kgCO₂ emitted**\n",
    "which directly addresses the sustainability outcomes defined in the Week 1 project significance statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because evaluation now occurs fully within the Vimeo-90K domain, consistent with the Week 4 methodological shift to avoid UVG overhead, the EES computation is efficient enough to run at multiple epochs and across multiple replicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Unified Vimeo-Only Benchmarking Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following Week 4’s reasoning that UVG’s raw 1080p YUV sequences were prohibitively expensive for rapid iteration and carbon-aware experimentation, all benchmarking this week was redesigned around Vimeo-90K exclusively:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The test split now serves as the definitive benchmark for PSNR and EES.\n",
    "* All comparative plots (Loss, PSNR, EES) now rely solely on the Vimeo distribution.\n",
    "* Evaluation is fast enough to execute after every training epoch, even across 5 replicates per model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision accelerated experimentation, reduced compute waste, and strengthened methodological consistency with EQODEC’s environmental mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Visualization of Training Dynamics and Sustainability Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "To support interpretability, three major visualization modules were implemented this week:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Loss curves (train vs. validation)**\n",
    "* **PSNR progression across epochs**\n",
    "* **EES curves comparing EQODEC vs. Baseline**\n",
    "\n",
    "These plots highlight several insights consistent with Week 4 observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* EQODEC maintains or slightly improves PSNR compared to the baseline.\n",
    "* EES values show modest but consistent gains for the carbon-aware model.\n",
    "* Variance across replicates is reduced due to validation-based checkpointing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings reinforce Week 4’s conclusion that sustainability-aware optimization does not harm visual quality and may provide measurable benefits in energy-efficient compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Additional Contributions: Frame Reconstruction Export Utility**\n",
    "\n",
    "A new module was added to generate side-by-side qualitative comparisons of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Original frames\n",
    "* EQODEC reconstructions\n",
    "* Baseline reconstructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature supports visual inspection and future inclusion in the project’s final paper or presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Challenges Encountered**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several practical challenges were addressed this week:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. FFmpeg process stability:** Occasional stalls were fixed by carefully managing stdin closure and suppressing stderr buffering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. GPU memory limits:** Chunk-based inference was extended to both training and evaluation, following lessons learned in Week 3’s inference stability fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Carbon intensity estimation variability:** CodeCarbon's returned data can vary per machine, so consistent fallback logic was implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Training time explosion during multi-run evaluation:** The exclusive use of Vimeo-90K significantly mitigated this issue, confirming Week 4’s pivot as both necessary and beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 5 represents the final stabilization and maturation phase of the EQODEC project. The entire end-to-end pipeline, including data loading, model architecture, carbon-aware training, multi-run evaluation, EES benchmarking, visualization, and qualitative comparison, has now been fully implemented and operationalized. This expands on the foundational dataset work from Weeks 1–3 and the early evaluation methodology from Week 4, creating a complete experimental ecosystem capable of supporting rigorous scientific analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite shifting to a Vimeo-only evaluation strategy, the results this week continue to support a key emerging conclusion also observed in Week 4:\n",
    "**carbon-aware optimization does not degrade compression quality and may improve sustainability performance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the full framework complete and all core objectives achieved, this week concludes the primary development cycle of EQODEC. The system is now ready for final documentation, result interpretation, and integration into the project's final research output."
