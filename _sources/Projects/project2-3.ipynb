    "This week marked the transition from data preparation to the full training and evaluation phase of EQODEC, our carbon-aware deep learning framework for sustainable video compression. Building on previously completed data collection and preprocessing workflows where Vimeo-90K septuplets and UVG videos were properly indexed and organized, the focus shifted toward finalizing the training pipeline, integrating the carbon-aware components, and optimizing the computational efficiency of the entire system.\n",

    "The week's efforts concentrated on three major fronts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stabilizing and enhancing the EQODEC autoencoder training loop\n",
    "2. Implementing high-fidelity evaluation methods, including EES computation\n",
    "3. Improving runtime efficiency using AMP and ffmpeg streaming optimizations\n",

    "This week's progress focused on fully stabilizing and optimizing the EQODEC model training pipeline, enabling end-to-end carbon-aware video compression using the Vimeo-90K and UVG datasets. The ConvLSTM autoencoder was successfully integrated with a clean reconstruction–carbon loss formulation, while a standalone CarbonModule ensured flexible computation of the sustainability objective introduced in the project background. Major performance improvements were achieved through Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), ffmpeg-based streaming optimizations, and chunked 1080p inference, resulting in faster, more energy-efficient training and evaluation. Full training of both the EQODEC model and the MSE-only baseline was completed, with automatic checkpointing and consistent PSNR tracking. Additionally, the Energy Efficiency Score (EES) evaluator and UVG benchmark were fully operational, enabling realistic high-resolution testing and carbon-footprint assessment. Overall, this week established a stable, efficient, and carbon-aware training and evaluation workflow, marking a significant advancement toward EQODEC's sustainability-centered objectives."
