    "This week marked a major milestone in the EQODEC project: the full integration of a three-way train/validation/test split, the implementation of robust multi-run evaluation, and the first comprehensive comparison between the EQODEC model and the baseline autoencoder under controlled experimental conditions. Building on the data acquisition and preprocessing work established earlier where Vimeo-90K was selected as the primary training dataset due to its temporally consistent septuplets and split into structured subsets for efficient experimentation, this week’s focus shifted toward evaluating model behavior under environmentally informed objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Initial Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "After running five replicates per model, the results demonstrate that EQODEC slightly outperforms the baseline model, both in Energy Efficiency Score (EES) and in reconstruction quality (PSNR). While the improvements are modest, the key takeaway is that introducing carbon-awareness into the loss function does not degrade compression quality, an essential proof of concept for sustainability-aware machine learning. Moreover, the newly added test split ensures that all reported metrics reflect unbiased generalization performance, resolving earlier concerns about overfitting to the validation set.\n",

    "### **Tuning and Training Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several tuning changes played meaningful roles in this week’s improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local Carbon Intensity Estimation**:\n",
    "The pipeline now queries CodeCarbon to obtain a dynamic estimate of regional carbon intensity before training. This allows λ₍c₎ to be interpreted consistently across different machines. This aligns with the environmental motivation outlined in the project's background, where reducing energy and CO₂ impact is a central design goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Energy-Aware Loss Balancing**:\n",
    "Using λ₍c₎ = 0.005 for EQODEC encouraged small but consistent reductions in latent magnitude, indicating the model is learning to embed energy efficiency into its representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Checkpointing via Validation Loss**:\n",
    "Selecting the best-performing epoch per replicate contributed to reduced variance and stronger consistency across runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AMP + Chunked Inference**:\n",
    "Mixed precision and chunk-level inference minimized unnecessary overhead during evaluation and supported more stable EES computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Discussion and Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical challenge encountered this week was dataset selection for large-scale experimentation. While the original project proposal considered Vimeo-90K for training and UVG for high-resolution benchmarking, the UVG dataset stored in raw 1080p YUV format is computationally expensive to process, especially for neural models that perform temporal and spatial operations on every frame. Decoding and evaluating these long sequences would require multiple hours per run and exceed the available GPU memory, making frequent training and tuning cycles impractical. For this reason, we decided to use only the Vimeo-90K dataset for both experimentation and final benchmarking. This choice significantly reduces computational load, simplifies the pipeline, and ensures that EES and PSNR can be measured consistently across replicates. It also aligns with the project’s sustainability goals by prioritizing efficient experimentation without compromising the integrity of the comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite using Vimeo exclusively, the results still provide strong evidence that EQODEC’s carbon-aware objective does not harm performance and may even improve energy-aware compression efficiency. The modest but consistent gains in EES suggest that the model is responding to the sustainability signal but may require more advanced architectural mechanisms such as entropy coding, bottleneck restructuring, or dynamic λ₍c₎ scheduling, to achieve larger improvements."
